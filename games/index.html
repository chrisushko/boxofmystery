<BR>Ever wonder what the stars are doing when nobody's looking? "Starstruck" was a two-week project made for the 2019 Adventure Jam. In it, you play as a constellation exploring the night sky in his quest for a cosmic meet-cute. The game was inspired by the solar system books I read to my son when he has younger.

Get your numPad skills ready for an ascension into the unknown as you face the greatest threat to 1980's gaming: stairs! "Stair Quest" is a cold, merciless battle for your soul as your patience and footwork are put to the ultimate test.
<BR><B>Daddy Rating:</B> Should be okay? Features a scary monster. Otherwise, don't type anything and tempt fate. I don't know what kind of surprises the writers hid in here.</FONT>

<BR>Journey back in time to Old York City where the world's greatest detective must solve the case of a mysterious food poisoning. This is my first fully 3D game made in Unity, and my first original game featuring a full voice cast.

<BR>I drew artwork, wrote puzzles, and voiced a talking parrotfish in this collaboration with <B>No More For Today Productions</B> for the 2016 Adventure Jam. Play as Morgan, a woman who parties a little too hard the night before and has to retrace her steps through three fantasy worlds for her missing junk. Features muppet vampires, a swearing owl, and a full voice cast, including famed "Murder, She Wrote" aficionado <I><A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/user/pushinguproses">PushingUpRoses</I></A> as the Narrator.
<BR><B>Daddy Rating:</B> Maybe not okay. Lots of bleeped swearing, suggestive humour, and alcohol use. It's basically about a pub crawl gone wrong.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE="4"><I><B>Released:</B> January 11, 2012</I>
<BR><I><B>Engine:</B> Adventure Game Studio</I>
<BR>The galaxy is at war. A doomsday weapon is on the move. And all hope rests with a guy who can't even find his luggage. "Incinerations" is my personal full-length fan-sequel to Sierra's "Space Quest" and acts as an unofficial conclusion to the series. With over six years of development, "Incinerations" is a critically-acclaimed space opera, with over 45 minutes of animated cut-scenes, pre-rendered 3D graphics, and epic scores by Frederik Olsen and Matthew Chastney.
<BR><B>Daddy Rating:</B> Okay-ish, but not the most kid-friendly. Lots of action, shooting, explosions - no blood. Some light swearing. Was intended to be as bad as a PG-13 movie. Features an infamous drug mixing puzzle that looked better on paper.</FONT>

<BR><I><B>Engine:</B> Adventure Game Studio</I>

<BR>The quest for space continues! VSB is a full-length "Space Quest" sequel, set after the events of the non-existent "Space Quest 7". In it, famous space janitor Roger Wilco takes his wife-to-be on a date to a horrible ice planet just to avoid having a serious conversation. Of course, dangers lurk on this icy world and Roger must soon lead a revolution against his old arch-nemesis, Sludge Vohaul. This game is a team effort by <B>VSB Team</B>, long-time friends of BOM and the SQ community.
<BR><B>Daddy Rating:</B> Barely okay-ish! Features crude humour, suggestive humour, European humour and cartoon blood. In other words, totally my jam.</FONT>

<BR>Oh, those crazy royals! Over at <B>Phoenix On-Line Studios</B>, dozens of devoted fans came together to create a fan-sequel to Sierra's "King's Quest" series. In it, a nasty wedding crasher sends King Graham on a quest across the Green Isles to save his children from a wicked curse. "The Silver Lining" is a four chapter saga written by Cesar Bittar, complete with 3D graphics and a full voice cast.
<BR><B>Daddy Rating:</B> Mostly okay. Contains scary imagery, a torture scene, and vegecide.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE="4"><I><B>Released:</B> April 4, 2003</I>
<BR><I><B>Engine:</B> Klik 'n Play</I>
<BR>This is one of the strangest things I've ever made, and yet one of the most downloaded. M:I-2 is a 'demake' of LucasArts' "Monkey Island 2", created using Windows Paint and Klik 'n Play, and retells the plot of the original game using outdated movie references from 2001. In fact, most of it is just "Fight Club" and "Matrix" jokes, so take it with a grain of salt as you try to get it running on your modern system.
<BR><B>Daddy Rating:</B> Contains very outdated references. Not recommended for millenials and up.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE="4"><I><B>Released:</B> November 27, 1999</I>
<BR><I><B>Engine:</B> Klik 'n Play</I>
<BR>This is my first full-length game. "The Devil's Triangle" is a fan-game that serves as a direct sequel to LucasArts' "The Secret of Monkey Island". In it, wannabe pirate Guybrush Threepwood teams up with a misfit crew and ventures into the heart of the Bermuda Triangle in search of an amazing treasure. It's from 1999, and even harder to run on modern systems, but you're welcome to try!
<BR><B>Daddy Rating:</B> Contains pixelized murder and mayhem.</FONT>
